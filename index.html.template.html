  <p>
  This document describes a formal model and a common representation 
  for a Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description. 
  A Thing Description describes the metadata and interfaces of Things, 
  where a Thing is an abstraction of a physical or virtual entity that 
  provides interactions to and participates in the Web of Things. 
  Thing Descriptions provide a set of interactions based on a small vocabulary 
  that makes it possible both to integrate diverse devices and 
  to allow diverse applications to interoperate. 
  Thing Descriptions, by default, are encoded in a JSON format that also allows
  JSON-LD processing. The latter provides a powerful foundation to represent
  knowledge about Things in a machine-understandable way.
  A Thing Description instance can be hosted by the Thing itself or hosted 
  externally when a Thing has resource restrictions (e.g., limited memory space) 
  or when a Web of Things-compatible legacy device is retrofitted 
  with a Thing Description.

  <section id="introduction">
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
  The Thing Description (TD) is a central building block in the W3C Web of
  Things (WoT) and can be considered as the entry point of a Thing
  (much like the <i>index.html</i> of a Web site).
  The TD consists of semantic metadata for the Thing itself,
  an interaction model based on WoT's <code>Properties</code>,
  <code>Actions</code>, and <code>Events</code> paradigm, 
  a semantic schema to make data models machine-understandable, 
  and features for Web Linking to express relations among Things. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Properties can be used for sensing and controlling parameters,
  such as getting the current value or setting an operation state.
  Actions model invocation of physical (and hence time-consuming) processes,
  but can also be used to abstract RPC-like calls of existing platforms. 
  Events are used for the push model of communication where notifications,
  discrete events, or streams of values are sent asynchronously to the receiver.
  In general, the TD provides metadata for different communication bindings 
  identified by URI schemes (e.g., "http", "coap", "mqtt", etc.),
  media types (e.g., "application/json", "application/xml", "application/cbor",
  "application/exi" etc.), and security mechanisms (for authentication,
  authorization, confidentiality, etc.).
  Serialization of TD instances is based on JSON and includes at least 
  the TD core vocabulary as JSON keys as defined in this specification document.
  </p>
  <p>
  Example 1 shows a simple TD instance in such a JSON serializiation and
  depicts WoT's <code>Properties</code>, <code>Actions</code>,
  and <code>Events</code> paradigm 
  by describing a lamp Thing with the name <i>MyLampThing</i>.
  </p>

     class="example" title="Simple Thing Description Sample with JSON serialization">
{
    "id": "urn:dev:wot:com:example:servient:lamp",
    "name": "MyLampThing",
    "security": [{"scheme": "basic"}],
    "properties": {
        "status" : {
            "type": "string",
            "forms": [{"href": "https://mylamp.example.com/status"}]
        }
    },
    "actions": {
        "toggle" : {
            "forms": [{"href": "https://mylamp.example.com/toggle"}]
        }
    },
    "events":{
        "overheating":{
            "data": {"type": "string"},
            "forms": [{
                "href": "https://mylamp.example.com/oh",
                "subprotocol": "longpoll"
            }]
        }
    }
}
</pre>
  <p>
  Based on this content, 
  we know there exists one <code>Property</code> interaction resource 
  with the name <i>status</i>. 
  In addition, 
  information is provided to indicate that this Property is accessible via 
  (the secure form of) the HTTP protocol with a GET method 
  at the URI <code>https://mylamp.example.com/status</code> 
  (announced within the <code>forms</code> structure by the 
  <code>href</code> key), and will return a string status value.
  The use of the GET method is not stated explicitly, 
  but is one of the default assumptions defined by this document.
  </p>
  <p>
  In a similar manner, an <code>Action</code> is specified to toggle the
  switch status using the POST method applied to the 
  <code>https://mylamp.example.com/toggle</code> resource,
  where POST is again a default assumption for invoking Actions.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <code>Event</code> pattern enables a mechanism for asynchronous messages
  to be sent by a Thing.
  Here, a subscription to be notified upon a possible overheating event 
  of the lamp can be obtained by using the HTTP with its long polling
  sub-protocol at <code>https://mylamp.example.com/oh</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
  This example also specifies the <code>basic</code> security scheme, 
  requiring a username and password for access.
  In combination with the use of the HTTP protocol this indicates the use of 
  HTTP Basic Authentication.
  Specification of at least one security scheme at the top level is mandatory,
  and gives the default access requirements for every resource.
  However, security schemes can also be specified per-interaction or per-form,
  with lower-level configurations overriding higher-level ones,
  allowing for the specification of fine-grained access control.
  It is also possible to use a special <code>nosec</code> security scheme to
  indicate that no access control mechanisms are used.
  Examples are provided later.
  </p>
  <p>
  The TD in Example 1 reflects some additional defined default assumptions 
  that are not explicitly described. 
  For example, the media type of the 
  exchange format of the interactions is assumed to be JSON 
  (=<code>contentType</code>) and the <code>Property</code> <i>status</i> 
  resource is not <code>readOnly</code> as well as not <code>observable</code>. 
  Specifically, 
  the TD specification defines vocabulary terms 
  (<code>readOnly</code>, <code>observable</code>, <code>contentType</code>) 
  that have default values. 
  If these vocabulary terms are not explicitly used in a Thing Description 
  instance, 
  the Thing Description processor follows default assumptions for 
  interpretation as defined in this specification.
  </p>

  <p>
  The TD can be also processed as an RDF-based model. 
  In that case, the Thing Description instance needs to be transformed
  into valid JSON-LD first.  
  In terms of JSON-LD 1.1 serialization, 
  the open-world assumption of RDF semantic processing requires vocabulary terms
  with default values to be always present explicitly in the instances. 
  Example 2 shows the same TD in a JSON-LD 1.1 serializiation representing
  exactly the same information as in Example 1; however, default values
  have been filled in.

  <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <p>Generic WoT terminology is defined in [[!WOT-ARCHITECTURE]]: 
  <dfn data-lt="Things">Thing</dfn>, 
  <dfn data-lt="Thing Descriptions">Thing Description</dfn> 
    (in short <dfn>TD</dfn>), 
  <dfn>Web of Things</dfn> (in short <b><i>WoT</i></b>),  
  <dfn>WoT Interface</dfn> etc.
  </p>

  <section>
  <h1>Namespaces</h1>
  <p>
  The namespace for the W3C TD vocabulary as defined in 
  this document is <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/td">http://www.w3.org/ns/td</a>. 
  </p> 
  <p>
  Using content negotiation,  this namespace serves either the TD ontology file (Turtle) 
  or the TD context file (JSON-LD).
  </p>
  <p>
    The suggested prefix for the TD namespace is <code>td</code>.      
  </p>
  <p>
  The security ontology that can be used with the TD 
  is available at 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/wot-security">https://www.w3.org/ns/wot-security</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The data schema ontology that can be used with the TD is 
  available at 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/json-schema">https://www.w3.org/ns/json-schema</a>. 
  </p>

  <p class="ednote" title="Binding Vocabulary and Prefixes">
   The TD will reuse existing vocabulary definitions such as for http from the 
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/http#">http://www.w3.org/2011/http#</a> namespace. In that case the prefix <code>http</code> is used. However, there are prefixes such as
   <code>coap</code> and <code>mqtt</code> which have no namespace yet. Currently there are efforts to have such namespace representations which will be referenced in the 
   TD specification in the future. In the meantime,  the [[!WOT-PROTOCOL-BINDING]] provides the list of terms that can be used to specify the protocol metadata in the Thing Description.

  <h1>Thing Description Serialization</h1>

  <p class="ednote" title="JSON-LD 1.1">
  This is the first draft that uses JSON-LD 1.1 as a serialization format 
  of the Thing Description. 
  As that is work in progress, working assumptions are based on the latest
  <a href="https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/#">Community Draft of JSON-LD 1.1</a>. 
  A new JSON-LD Working Group has already been
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/03/jsonld-wg-charter.html">chartered</a>.
  It is planned that this section will conform to the latest working draft 
  of their JSON-LD 1.1 deliverable and only use stable elements.
  </p>

  <p>
  Thing Description instances are modeled and structured based on Section
  <a href="#sec-vocabulary-definition"></a>.
  This section defines a TD serialization based on JSON [[!RFC8259]].
  </p>

  <section id="json-serializiation-section">
  <h1>Representation Format</h1>

  <p>
  The JSON serialization of TDs follows the syntax of JSON-LD 1.1
  in order to streamline semantic evaluation.
  Hence, serializations can be parsed either as raw JSON or with a JSON-LD 1.1
  processor.
  </p>

  <p>
  In order to enable this convergence,
  all vocabulary terms defined in Section
  <a href="#sec-vocabulary-definition"></a>
  will have a JSON key representation.

    is to be considered invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
    The <code>nosec</code> security scheme is provided for the case that 
    no security is needed.
    The minimal security configuration for a Thing is configuration 
    of the <code>nosec</code> security scheme 
    at the top level, as in the following example:
    </p>
<pre class="example">
{
    "id": "urn:dev:wot:com:example:servient:myThing",
    "name": "MyThing",
    "description": "Additional (human) readable information of the Thing.",
    "support": "https://servient.example.com/contact",
    "security": [{"scheme": "nosec"}],
    "properties": {...},
    "actions": {...},
    "events": {...},
    "links": [...]
}
</pre> 

    <p>
    To give a more complex example, 
    suppose we have a Thing where all interactions
    require basic authentication except for one interaction for which
    no authentication is required.
    In the following, the <code>nosec</code> scheme for
    the security configuration in the <code>overheating</code> event 
    to indicate no authentication is required.  
    For the <code>status</code> property and the <code>toggle</code>
    action, however, <code>basic</code> authentication is required as defined
    at the top level of the Thing.
    </p>
<pre class="example">
{
    ...
    "security": [{"scheme": "basic"}],
    "properties": {
        "status": {
            ...
            "forms": [{
                "href": "https://mylamp.example.com/status",
                "contentType": "application/json",
            }]
        }
    },
    "actions": {
        "toggle": {
            ...
            "forms": [{
                "href": "https://mylamp.example.com/toggle",
                "contentType": "application/json"
            }]
        }
    },
    "events": {
        "overheating": {
            ...
            "forms": [{
                "href": "https://mylamp.example.com/oh",
                "contentType": "application/json",
                "security": [{"scheme": "nosec"}] 
            }]
        }
    }
}
</pre>

      <p>
      Security definitions can also can be given for different elements
      at the same level.  This may be required for devices that support
      multiple protocols, for example CoAP and HTTP, with support for different
      security mechanisms.  This is also useful when alternative authentication
      mechanisms are allowed.  Here is a TD snippet demonstrating three possible
      ways to access a resource: via HTTPS with basic authentication, via HTTPS
      via digest authentication, or via CoAPS with an API key.
      In other words, 
      the use of multiple security configurations at the same level 
      provides a way to combine security mechanisms an in "OR" fashion.
      In contrast, putting multiple security configurations in the same
      <code>security</code> field combines them in an "AND" fashion, 
      since in that case
      they would all need to be satisfied to allow access to the resource.

  To validate the semantic meaning and follow references to external

  <h2>JSON-LD 1.1 Processing</h2>

  <p>To interpret the semantic meaning of a Thing Description
  in terms of RDF triples, 
  a Thing Description instance first requires a valid JSON-LD 1.1 
  representation based on this Thing Description specification. 
  Then this representation can be passed to a JSON-LD 1.1 processor.
  </p>

  <p><!-- The following is not marked as a testable assertion because it 
          simply says the next three are assertions.
          The subassertions have been reworded so they can be understood 
          independently as referring to preprocessing.
          This is why "must" is in lower case.  -->
  The following pre-processing steps of a Thing Description instance 
  must be executed before starting JSON-LD 1.1 processing:
  <ul>
  <li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-jsonld-preprocessing-context">
     Before starting JSON-LD 1.1 processing of a Thing Description instance,
     there MUST be a <code>@context</code> key from JSON-LD 1.1 as defined 
     in Section 
     <a href="#sec-thing-as-a-whole-json"></a>.
  </span></li>
  <li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-jsonld-preprocessing-prefix">
     Before starting JSON-LD 1.1 processing of a Thing Description instance,
     all external vocabulary terms used in the Thing Description MUST 
     provide their context URIs as prefix or within the <code>@context</code>
     field.

  <li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-jsonld-preprocessing-defaults">

  <!-- FIX: Actually, the examples in the next section
       are not that good because they
